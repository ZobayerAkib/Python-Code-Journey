# Python-Code-Journey

This repository, **Python-Code-Journey**, is where I document and share my learning journey in Python programming. Each file and directory contains various Python scripts and projects, showcasing different aspects of Python, including data structures, algorithms, OOP principles, and more advanced topics. All code is written and tested using **Python 3.12.3** in **PyCharm 2024.2.4 (Community Edition)** for consistency and ease of debugging.

## Environment

- **Python Version**: Python 3.12.3
- **IDE**: PyCharm 2024.2.4 (Community Edition), Build #PC-242.23726.102

## Repository Structure

- **Basics**: Core Python syntax, variables, data types, and control structures.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations and examples of lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and more.
- **Functions and Modules**: Custom functions, module creation, and imports.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.
- **File Handling**: Working with files in Python, including reading, writing, and error handling.
- **Advanced Topics**: Scripts covering advanced libraries and frameworks as I explore more Python features.


## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12.3**: Ensure Python 3.12.3 is installed for compatibility.
- **PyCharm 2024.2.4 (Community Edition)**: (Optional but recommended) Using this IDE version ensures compatibility with the same environment used during development.

## Usage

This repository is designed to serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in Python programming. Feel free to use the scripts, modify them, and experiment with different implementations.
